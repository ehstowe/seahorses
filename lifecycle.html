<hr color="darkorange" />
<h2>According to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, a seahorse's life cycle has six stages.</h2>
<h3>Stage 1: Adult</h3>
<p>Adult seahorses stay around the same place for most of their life. They attach themselves
to grasses or reefs and eat both plants and small animals.</p>
<h3>Stage 2: Daily Greeting</h3>
<p>A male and female seahorse meet each other.</p>
<h3>Stage 3: Courtship</h3>
<p>Eggs develop in the female and are passed to the male's "brood pouch" through a tube.</p>
<h3>Stage 4: Pregnancy</h3>
<p>The male seahorse's pouch grows and he provides nutrients for the eggs.</p>
<h3>Stage5: Birth</h3>
<p>The male seahorse pushes out many tiny seahorses.</p>
<h3>Stage 6: Juvenile</h3>
<p>The baby seahorses find a safe place to live and find food.</p>
