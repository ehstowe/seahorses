<h2>According to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, a seahorse's life cycle has six stages.</h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>Adult: </b>Adult seahorses stay around the same place for most of their life. They attach themselves
    to grasses or reefs and eat both plants and small animals.</li>
  <li><b>Daily Greeting: </b>A male and female seahorse meet each other.</li>
  <li><b>Courtship: </b>Eggs develop in the female and are passed to the male's "brood pouch" through a tube.</li>
  <li><b>Pregnancy: </b>The male seahorse's pouch grows and he provides nutrients for the eggs.</li>
  <li><b>Birth: </b>The male seahorse pushes out many tiny seahorses, which can be as small as the size of a fingernail.</li>
  <li><b>Juvenile: </b>The baby seahorses, called fry, find a safe place to live and find food.</li>
